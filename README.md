# phenoEOS

This repository includes the scripts to analyse the relationships between CO2 assimilation and phenological dates.
We use multi-decadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet ‐ in spite of the negative Anet‐EOS relationship at the interannual scale. 

The repository is organized as follows:
data - includes the scripts for data cleaning and the clean data which is used in analysis.
analysis - includes the scripts for data analysis.
manuscript - includes figures and other outputs.
R - overall functions which are recycled.
src - not R specific functions.
